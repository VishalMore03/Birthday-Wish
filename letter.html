        <h1 class="main-title">Love Letter to my cutie</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">Hello sweety, I wanted to give this on a piece of paper but situations do not permit me to do so and this is how present it. So sweety the thing is, I want to confess my feeling to you.</p>
        
        <p class="section-text">I still remember the first time I saw you! you were hiding behind the mask, and I was unaware that she will be the one. The one who will make my heart beat faster, the one with whom I will be so open to talk to, the one who will believe in me, the one I will have crush on, the one with whom I will want to spend my life.</p>

        <p class="section-text">Spending time with you feel life a very peaceful sunset view on a beach. I like this beach time we spend. This time together is something I will cherish forever. Beach view is not the only seen I like, I love to stare at you and look at every detail that my eyes can catch. I like your eye, smile, lips, your skin, you smell, literally everything. Your eyes are so pretty that I can look in it tirelessly. They are like stars twinkling providing the mid night light. When you visited on my birthday having eye contact with you was so intimidating that I was not able to maintain it. That smile of yours can make anyone smile back at you, it looks so cute on your face providing warmness like a sunrise. Your smile is surrounded by those soft lips which have the best sweetest taste. I don’t like sweets but with those lips I will happily accept diabetes. I like your touch, l like to hold your hand feel you and your presence. And one thing I want to tell you is that, don’t be with the doubt that your skin-color makes you less attractive, you skin color perfectly matches with you body feature making you even hotter. Babe, you have a very sexy body with a very cute face. I am lucky or should I say, my Bhagya is with me to have you as my Girlfriend who has such deadly combination.</p>

        <p class="section-text">Sometimes I wonder how can I get such a cutie as my wife. I though about it can came to conclusion that, when I was born, God was like this kid will not cope-up with the world. He needs mental peace with him, then with proper calculation which took twenty-five days he made my partner, a mental piece. You are mental piece that gave me mental-peace. I want to thank you for taking birth for me.</p>

        <p class="section-text">HAPPY BIRTHDAY My sweet little imagination. You are Destined to be mine and mine alone.</p>

        <p class="section-text">If you thing these words are able to describe what I feel then you are wrong. I don’t know how to describe the feeling that make me blush after hearing your name. The feeling of finding all the romantic songs describing you. The feeling when I hear your voice. The feeling when I see your messages. AAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>

        <p class="section-text">I LOVE YOU MY SWEET SWEET HONEY. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!</p>
